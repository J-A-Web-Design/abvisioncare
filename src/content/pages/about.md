        We at Alberta Vision Care believe that providing excellent eye care is
        key in helping our patients optimize their overall health and quality of
        life. We understand that from the time we wake up, our eyes allow us to
        experience the world in a manner unparalleled by any of our other
        senses. It is this appreciation for how important a role your eyes play
        in your life that fuels us to continually provide the best care we can
        to maintain them.

        Our board certified optometrists use their clinical experience and
        extensive knowledge to diagnose and manage the wide array of ocular
        diseases our patients encounter. Having an integrative approach that
        combines technologies such as retinal cameras, and visual field
        machines, with a patient centered approach through patient education and
        collaboration, helps ensure that we provide the best care and experience
        for all of our patients.
