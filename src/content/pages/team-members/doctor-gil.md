        Dr. Gill, originally from the Philippines, moved to Edmonton with her
        family at the age of six. She pursued her undergraduate studies at the
        University of Saskatchewan before joining the Optometry program at
        Western University of Health Sciences. Her dedication to the field is
        evident from her volunteer work, including providing free eye exams in
        underserved communities in Mexico and participating in various
        charitable initiatives such as fundraisers and vision screenings in
        Southern California.


        Dr. Gill completed her Doctorate in Optometry in 2015, having gained
        extensive experience during her externship year across several states,
        including Florida, Washington, Michigan, and Ontario. Her training
        covered areas such as Pediatric & Vision Therapy, Post-operative Care,
        Ocular Disease, and Specialty Contact Lenses. In addition to her
        proficiency in English, she speaks fluent Punjabi. Outside of her
        professional life, Dr. Gill enjoys traveling and spending time outdoors
        with her family.
