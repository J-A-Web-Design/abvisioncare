      - question: What is an Optometrist?
        answer:
          markdown_content: >-
            The Canadian Association of Optometrists (CAO) defines an
            optometrist, or Doctor of Optometry, as an independent primary
            health care provider with expertise in examining, diagnosing,
            treating, managing, and preventing diseases and disorders related to
            the visual system, the eyes, and their associated structures.
            Additionally, optometrists are skilled in identifying ocular
            manifestations of systemic conditions.


            Optometrists fulfill several key responsibilities as primary eye
            care providers, including:


            1. **Examination of the Eye**: Using various methods (excluding
            surgery) to diagnose, treat, and/or refer abnormal eye conditions.
            They work in coordination with physicians and other healthcare
            professionals to ensure comprehensive care.

            2. **Use of Instruments and Procedures**: Employing specialized
            tools and techniques to measure, examine, and diagnose visual
            defects or eye abnormalities.

            3. **Prescription of Corrective Devices**: Prescribing, fitting, and
            applying glasses, contact lenses, or other devices to correct,
            relieve, or treat visual impairments.

            4. **Management of Visual Health**: Overseeing and managing therapy
            to improve or monitor visual health, including follow-up care.

            5. **Patient Referrals**: Referring patients to other healthcare
            practitioners when necessary for further evaluation or treatment.


            Optometrists play a crucial role in maintaining eye health and
            overall visual function, working both independently and
            collaboratively with other healthcare providers.
