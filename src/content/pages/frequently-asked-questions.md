      - question: What is an Optometrist?
        answer: >-
          The Canadian Association of Optometrists (CAO) defines an optometrist,
          or Doctor of Optometry, as an independent primary health care provider
          with expertise in examining, diagnosing, treating, managing, and
          preventing diseases and disorders related to the visual system, the
          eyes, and their associated structures. Additionally, optometrists are
          skilled in identifying ocular manifestations of systemic conditions.
