      heading: Your Guide to Eye Exams and Care at Alberta Vision Care
      markdown_content: >-
        At Alberta Vision Care, we recommend regular eye exams to maintain
        optimal vision health. Hereâ€™s a summary of our recommendations and
        services:


        **General Eye Exam Recommendations:**


        * **Ages 19 to 64:** We suggest having your eyes examined every two
        years.

        * **Contact Lens Wearers:** Annual eye exams are essential.


        **Health Conditions and Vision:** Certain conditions like diabetes and
        hypertension can increase the risk of vision problems. Early detection
        is crucial, as it allows for timely treatment and prevention of
        permanent damage. Our optometrists will discuss treatment options and
        monitor your condition closely.


        **Comprehensive Eye Exam Includes:**


        * Glasses Prescription

        * Internal and external eye examination

        * Eye pressure measurement

        * Complete ocular and medical history

        * Visual Acuity

        * Eye teaming evaluation


        **Pediatric Eye Exam:**


        * **Coverage:** Children from six months to nineteen years are covered
        under Alberta Health Care with a valid Alberta Health Card.

        * **Recommendation:** The first eye check-up should occur before the
        child turns one year old to identify any issues early and provide
        necessary treatment.


        **Senior Eye Exam:**


        * **Coverage:** Individuals over 65 receive annual eye exams under
        Alberta Health Care with a valid card.

        * **Recommendation:** Annual check-ups are advised due to age-related
        changes. We monitor conditions like glaucoma, macular degeneration, and
        cataracts, particularly in relation to hypertension or diabetes.


        **Emergencies:**


        * **During Office Hours:** Contact our office immediately if you
        experience an eye injury or sudden visual problems.

        * **After Hours:** Visit the Royal Alexandra Hospital Emergency Room at
        10240 Kingsway Ave NW, Edmonton.


        **Emergency Situations to Address:**


        * Redness and irritation

        * Itching or burning eyes

        * Light sensitivity

        * Sharp pain

        * Discharge

        * Floaters, flashing lights, or a veil sensation in peripheral vision
